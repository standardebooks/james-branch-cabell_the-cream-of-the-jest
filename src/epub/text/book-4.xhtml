		<l>“But there were dreams to sell</l>
		<l>Ill didst thou buy:</l>
		<l>Life is a dream, they tell,</l>
		<l>Waking to die.</l>
		<l>Dreaming a dream to prize,</l>
		<l>Is wishing ghosts to rise;</l>
		<l>And, if I had the spell</l>
		<l>To call the buried — well,</l>
		<l>Which one would I?”</l>
