			<l>“This was the measure of my soul's delight;</l>
			<l>It had no power of joy to fly by day,</l>
			<l>Nor part in the large lordship of the light;</l>
			<l>But in a secret moon-beholden way</l>
			<l>Had all its will of dreams and pleasant night,</l>
			<l>And all the love and life that sleepers may.</l>

		<lg type="stanza">
			<l>“But such life's triumph as men waking may</l>
			<l>It might not have to feed its faint delight.”</l>
